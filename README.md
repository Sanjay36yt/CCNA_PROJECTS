# **CCNA Projects Repository** 🌐💻

Welcome to my repository where I document and share all my hands-on CCNA networking projects! This collection showcases practical applications of networking concepts that I have learned during my journey toward earning the **CCNA** certification. 

### 📂 **What’s Inside**:
- **Network Configurations**: Step-by-step guides on setting up various network devices, such as switches, routers, and PCs.
- **Subnetting Projects**: Real-world subnetting exercises to practice IP addressing and network segmentation.
- **Troubleshooting Scenarios**: Solutions and tips for common networking issues, tested and verified in **Packet Tracer**.
- **Network Design**: Full network setups for small and medium businesses, including IP address management, subnetting, and device configuration.

### 🔑 **Key Learning Areas**:
- **IP Addressing & Subnetting**: Design and implement efficient IP schemes and subnet masks.
- **Routing & Switching**: Configure routers and switches to establish communication between devices.
- **Network Security**: Basic security measures such as ACLs and VLANs to protect the network.
- **Real-World Scenarios**: Networking projects based on industry use cases, such as office LAN setups, remote site connections, and more.

Feel free to explore the projects and learn by doing! I'm actively updating this repository as I continue to deepen my knowledge and work on new challenges.

### 📈 **About Me**:
I am currently a **CCNA student**, committed to learning networking fundamentals through practical, real-world projects. These projects serve as a great way to share my progress with the community and contribute to the network engineering field.

### 🚀 **Let’s Connect**:
If you're a fellow learner, network professional, or mentor, I’d love to connect! Feel free to check out my other networking-related resources and share feedback on my projects.
